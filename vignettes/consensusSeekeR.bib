abstract = {Nucleosomes are the basic elements of chromatin structure. They control the packaging of DNA and play a critical role in gene regulation by allowing physical access to transcription factors. The advent of second-generation sequencing has enabled landmark genome-wide studies of nucleosome positions for several model organisms. Current methods to determine nucleosome positioning first compute an occupancy coverage profile by mapping nucleosome-enriched sequenced reads to a reference genome; then, nucleosomes are placed according to the peaks of the coverage profile. These methods are quite accurate on placing isolated nucleosomes, but they do not properly handle more complex configurations. Also, they can only provide the positions of nucleosomes and their occupancy level, whereas it is very beneficial to supply molecular biologists additional information about nucleosomes like the probability of placement, the size of DNA fragments enriched for nucleosomes and/or whether nucleosomes are well positioned or 'fuzzy' in the sequenced cell sample.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: MNase-Seq and ChIP-Seq have evolved as popular techniques to study chromatin and histone modification. Although many tools have been developed to identify enriched regions, software tools for nucleosome positioning are still limited. We introduce a flexible and powerful open-source R package, PING 2.0, for nucleosome positioning using MNase-Seq data or MNase- or sonicated- ChIP-Seq data combined with either single-end or paired-end sequencing. PING uses a model-based approach, which enables nucleosome predictions even in the presence of low read counts. We illustrate PING using two paired-end datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and compare its performance with nucleR and ChIPseqR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: PING 2.0 is available from the Bioconductor website at http://bioconductor.org. It can run on Linux, Mac and Windows.},

At the core of the infrastructure are three packages: IRanges, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures. These packages provide scalable data structures for representing annotated ranges on the genome, with special support for transcript structures, read alignments and coverage vectors. Computational facilities include efficient algorithms for overlap and nearest neighbor detection, coverage calculation and other range operations. This infrastructure directly supports more than 80 other Bioconductor packages, including those for sequence analysis, differential expression analysis and visualization.},

@article{Tsankov2010,
abstract = {Chromatin organization plays a major role in gene regulation and can affect the function and evolution of new transcriptional programs. However, it can be difficult to decipher the basis of changes in chromatin organization and their functional effect on gene expression. Here, we present a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of the relationship between chromatin organization and gene expression, by measuring mRNA abundance and nucleosome positions genome-wide in 12 Hemiascomycota yeast species. We found substantial conservation of global and functional chromatin organization in all species, including prominent nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) at gene promoters, and distinct chromatin architecture in growth and stress genes. Chromatin organization has also substantially diverged in both global quantitative features, such as spacing between adjacent nucleosomes, and in functional groups of genes. Expression levels, intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences, and trans-acting chromatin modifiers all play important, complementary, and evolvable roles in determining NFRs. We identify five mechanisms that couple chromatin organization to evolution of gene regulation and have contributed to the evolution of respiro-fermentation and other key systems, including (1) compensatory evolution of alternative modifiers associated with conserved chromatin organization, (2) a gradual transition from constitutive to trans-regulated NFRs, (3) a loss of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences accompanying changes in chromatin organization and gene expression, (4) re-positioning of motifs from NFRs to nucleosome-occluded regions, and (5) the expanded use of NFRs by paralogous activator-repressor pairs. Our study sheds light on the molecular basis of chromatin organization, and on the role of chromatin organization in the evolution of gene regulation.},

@article{Kornberg1999,
abstract = {The proposal made 25 years ago that chromatin structure is based on a repeating unit of eight histone molecules and about 200 DNA base pairs (Kornberg, 1974) laid the basis for subsequent chromatin research. During the past few years, the X-ray structure of the repeating unit, termed the nucleosome, has been solved (Arents et al., 1991; Luger et al., 1997), and its biologic significance has emerged. The nucleosome is a focal point of transcription control, uniting previously disparate observations on gene activation and repression at the level of individual promoters, transcription units, and whole chromosomal domains (reviewed by Lewin, 1994; Grunstein, 1998; Kadonaga, 1998; Struhl, 1998; Bell and Felsenfeld, 1999). Connections withDNAreplication and the cell cycle, with recombination and other DNA transactions,and with viral infectionand cancerhavebecome apparent as well. This convergence of structural and functional studies gives occasion to celebrate the silver anniversary of the nucleosome.},

@article{Yang2014,
abstract = {ChIP-seq experiments identify genome-wide profiles of DNA-binding molecules including transcription factors, enzymes and epigenetic marks. Biological replicates are critical for reliable site discovery and are required for the deposition of data in the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. While early reports suggested two replicates were sufficient, the widespread application of the technique has led to emerging consensus that the technique is noisy and that increasing replication may be worthwhile. Additional biological replicates also allow for quantitative assessment of differences between conditions. To date it has remained controversial about how to confirm peak identification and to determine signal strength across biological replicates, particularly when the number of replicates is greater than two. Using objective metrics, we evaluate the consistency of biological replicates in ChIP-seq experiments with more than two replicates. We compare several approaches for binding site determination, including two popular but disparate peak callers, CisGenome and MACS2. Here we propose read coverage as a quantitative measurement of signal strength for estimating sample concordance. Determining binding based on genomic features, such as promoters, is also examined. We find that increasing the number of biological replicates increases the reliability of peak identification. Critically, binding sites with strong biological evidence may be missed if researchers rely on only two biological replicates. When more than two replicates are performed, a simple majority rule (>50\% of samples identify a peak) identifies peaks more reliably in all biological replicates than the absolute concordance of peak identification between any two replicates, further demonstrating the utility of increasing replicate numbers in ChIP-seq experiments.},

abstract = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},
