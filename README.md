sharedBed : Detect consensus peak regions inside a group of experiences using 
narrowPeak data
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adeschen/sharedBed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adeschen/sharedBed)

This R package compares multiple narrowPeak files to extract common peak 
regions. 
The size of the analyzed region is adjustable as well
as the number of experiences in which a peak must be detected to keep a 
potential region.
