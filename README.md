This R package compares multiple narrowPeak data from different experiments to extract common peak regions. 
The size of the analyzed region is adjustable, as well
as the number of experiences in which a peak must be present to tag a 
potential region as a consensus region. If needed, the consensus regions can be extended to cover the entire regions of enclosed peaks.
