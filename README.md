consensusSeekeR : Detect consensus peak regions inside a group of experiences using narrowPeak data
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adeschen/consensusSeekeR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adeschen/consensusSeekeR)

This R package compares multiple narrowPeak data from different experiments to extract common peak 
regions. 
The size of the analyzed region is adjustable, as well
as the number of experiences in which a peak must be detected to keep a 
potential region. If needed, the consensus regions can be extended to cover the entire regions of all enclosed peaks.
