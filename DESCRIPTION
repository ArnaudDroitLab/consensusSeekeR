Title: Detection of consensus regions inside a group of experiences using genomic positions and genomic ranges
Description: This package compares genomic positions and genomic ranges from
    multiple experiments
    to extract common regions. The size of the analyzed region is
    adjustable as well as the number of experiences in which a feature must be
    present in a potential region to tag this region as a consensus region.
