Title: Detection of consensus peak regions inside a group of experiences
    using narrowPeak data
Description: This package compares narrowPeak data from multiple experiments
    to extract common peak regions. The size of the analyzed region is
    adjustable as well as the number of experiences in which a peak must be
    present in a potential region to tag this region as a consensus region.
