\arguments{
\item{narrowPeakFiles}{a \code{vector} containing the narrowPeak files to
use.}

\item{chrList}{a \code{vector} containing the name of the chromosomes to
analyze or the name \code{"ALL"} which indicate that all
chromosomes must be analyzed. When \code{NULL}, no
new term is added. Default : \code{NULL}.}

\item{extendingSize}{a \code{numeric} value indicating the size of padding
at each side of the peaks median position to create the consensus
region. The minimum size of the consensu region will be equal to
twice the value of the \code{extendingSize} parameter. The size of
the \code{extendingSize} must be a positive integer. Default = 250.}

\item{includeAllPeakRegion}{a \code{logical} indicating if the region size,
which is set by the \code{extendingSize} parameter is extended to
include all region of the peak closest to the peaks median
position for each experiment.}

\item{minNbrExp}{a \code{numeric} indicating the minimum number of BED files
in which a peak must be present for a region to be retained. The
numeric must be a positive integer inferior or equal to the number
of files present in the \code{narrowpeaksBEDFiles} parameter.
Default = 1.}

\item{nbrThreads}{a \code{numeric} indicating the number of threads to use
         in parallel. The \code{nbrThreads} must be a positive integer.
         Default = 1.}

\description{
Find regions sharing the same features for a minimum number of
         experiments using narrowPeak files. The peaks and narrow regions
         are extracted from the narrowPeaks files and used to identify
         the common regions. The minimum number of experiments that must a
         peak in a common regions for that region to be selected is
         specified by user, as well as the size of padding. Only the
         chromosomes specified by the user are treated. The function can be
         parallized by specifying a number of threads superior to 1.

         When the padding is small, the detected regions are smaller than
         the one that could be obtained by doing an overlap of the narrow
         regions. Even more, the parameter specifying the minimum number of
         experiments needed to retain a region add versatility to the
         function.

         The side of the padding can have a large effect on the detected
         regions. It is recommanded to test more than one size and to do
         some manual validation of the resulting regions before selecting
         the final padding size.
