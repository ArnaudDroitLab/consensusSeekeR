\title{Sites with the greatest evidence of transcription factor binding
for the NR3C1 transcription factor from ENCODE (DDC accession: ENCFF002CFQ).
For demonstration purpose.}
\format{A \code{GRanges} containing one entry per site. The peaks are
surronded by ranges present in the dataset

\description{
Sites representing the greatest evidence of enrichment for
the NR3C1 transcription factor (DCC accession: ENCFF002CFQ)
for regions chr2:40000000-50000000 and chr3:10000000-13000000
from
the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data (Dunham I et al. 2012).
}
\details{
The peaks and ranges have been obtained using an optimal IDR analysis
done on all replicates.
